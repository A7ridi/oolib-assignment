# Project README

## Project Setup

This project is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend. Follow the instructions below to set up and run both servers simultaneously.

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the root folder**: This is where all the backend files are located.

2. **Install the necessary packages**:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend server uses `nodemon`, so it will automatically restart whenever changes are made to the backend files.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Move into the frontend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install the necessary packages**:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. **Start the frontend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Running Both Servers

By following the above steps, both the frontend and backend servers will be running simultaneously, allowing for a complete development environment setup.

---

With this setup, any changes made to the backend files will automatically restart the server, and the frontend server will be running concurrently to provide a seamless development experience.
